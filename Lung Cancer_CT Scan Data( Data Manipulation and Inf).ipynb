    "You are given a sample dataset ‘sample_dataset_for_testing.tar.gz’ . This is an anonymized sample Chest CT scan data. The dataset has 10 folders (subset[0-9]mask). Each subsetmask folder has one or many patient folders. Each patient folder has many tiff files. The tiff files numbering starts from 0.tiff , 1.tiff, 2.tiff ,….. N.tiff. Each tiff file represents a Chest CT slice. All slices together represent a 3D CT Chest scan for a patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each patient folder, you are also given n_mask.tiff files (n is an integer) wherever a mask is present. A mask file is a binary tiff file which represents the location of abnormality. So for example, if a mask file is of size 512 x 512 and out of all 262144 pixels, if 20 pixels have intensity > 0 , then it means that abnormality is present in these 20 pixels. Note that the mask file ‘n_mask.tiff’ is indicating the location of abnormality in ‘n.tiff’ slice. If a patient is normal, then there will not be any mask file present in his/ her folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "You goal is to design a Convolutional Neural Network to identify abnormalities in 3D Chest CT scans. So, given a test patient folder containing many tiff files, your network should be able to detect the location of abnormalities (similar to how a radiologist checks a patient’s 3D CT scan and marks abnormalities).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you have a small dataset, your model will not be robust. The goal of this exercise is not to test model’s robustness but to test your basic Python and deep learning skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can model the problem either as a segmentation or bounding box or pixel classification or any other way. You have the freedom to choose any standard architecture or design a small network from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want you to write a Python code for reading data, preprocessing and postprocessing. We want you to use a deep learning framework like PyTorch / Tensorflow / Caffe / Torch / Keras / Theano ( preferably PyTorch ) for training your network.\n",
    "You can split the dataset into training , validation and test as you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember , this is an exercise to test your python programming and basic deep learning modeling skills. You need not train your model for convergence or accuracy.\n",

    "     5) The Next challange for me was to stop the overwritting of files when they were copied from one directories to the another.\n",
    "     6) After Successfull tranfering the files in 2 classes, our challange is to build the classifier model. Hence, I am using a laptop without GPU I will train my model in Google Colab, then I will download the model for the predictions in the local machine.\n",
    "     7) A CNN architecture is created using Keras and tf as backend, hence our goal is not to get the accuracy.\n",
    "     8) The model is trained and the model is downloaded into the local machine for prediction.\n",
    "     9) As the size of the .h5 file is very large it is recomended to predict in the Google Colab, my system was hanged when I was trying to load the model.\n",
